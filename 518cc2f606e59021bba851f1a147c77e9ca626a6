      "message": "How copyright dates work is you only modify the date for the years you edited the file (It\u0027s a list or a range of dates from first creation to last edited). So it still needs to say 2015 since that was the date it was created. You can put:\n\n Copyright (c) 2015, 2016 Huawei ....\n\nIf you want to add this years date to the copyright but the original date of copyright must stay.
